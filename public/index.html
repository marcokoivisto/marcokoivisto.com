            <span class="large-letter">I</span> have always been very passionate
            about creating things, especially when it comes to IT. This interest
            starts way back, already from screwing in electronics at the age of
            five. With the deep passion for technology, the incentive to learn
            how a computer worked was very high. Early adoption at a young age
            gave me a significant advantage in the technology field. I quickly
            became the guy who helped friends, friends' parents, and my parent's
            job sites with IT work. These skills also helped me earn my own
            money from a young age and thereby keep up with the new and exciting
            technologies, which were a factor keeping me motivated back then. I
            loved browsing the internet, finding solutions for whatever issue I
            was solving.

            technology and being able to feel independent was what back then
            helped my interest in business to grow. I was executing different
            kinds of business from middle school until secondary school,
            including repairing electronics, selling them, and other IT
            services. Looking back at it now, I can see how my love for
            entrepreneurship was growing inside of me already at that time.

            studied information technology, which was the first time I tried
            having an actual teacher in the area. It was cool but similar to
            today, I already back then had strong beliefs of learning
            programming should be done by trial and error in a more industrial
            approach. In an entrepreneurship course
            <a target="_blank" href="https://ungforetagsamhet.se/"
              >(UF - Ung företagsamhet)</a
            >, four friends and I got the chance to do that, practice software
            development in an industrial approach. The class let us create our
            own youth company - which was to be named ”Dagens Växjö”. Our
            business focused on communicating daily lunch offers of nearby
            restaurants. The offers were presented on a website and mobile apps
            for Android and iOS that we had developed. It was a great ride,
            which gave us lots of experience in development, sales, economics,
            and social skills. The idea itself was also very appreciated and got
            rewarded with several prizes in different competitions, both in our
            hometown Växjö as well as in the capital of Sweden, Stockholm.

            secondary school, I started working remotely as a web developer for

            person coming to be one of the key persons to my further career
            decisions. After graduating, I moved to Gothenburg, where I
            continued a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering and
            Management. A half-year into my engineering studies - I and Jesper
            decided to leave our current work to start our own company.

            of my Bachelor studies, I was lucky to be nominated for studies
            abroad. I, therefore, stayed for roughly six months in Hangzhou,
            China, where I studied business culture and Mandarin at Zhejiang
            University. Moving to a new country by yourself with a foreign
            language, was something I noticed giving me more experience and
            value than most other parts of education. The exchange resulted in
            learnings of a new language, gaining a great understanding of
            differences among the Western and Asian business cultures. I also
            met new kinds of problem-solving scenarios, situations were there
            was no other possibility or way than to face, learn, and accept. In
            Hangzhou, I got in contact with
            <a target="_blank" href="https://netease-na.com/">Netease Games</a>,
            where I did a job as a game tester, which led to an experience of
            not only learning Chinese business culture in an academic aspect but
            also from an industrial point of view. Lastly, visiting China also
            gave me new insights into how differently living can be - which
            greatly affected what I value today.

            hi to Stockholm. After finishing my Bachelor studies in Gothenburg,
            I decided to pack my stuff and move to Stockholm. In Stockholm,
            besides running
            <a target="_blank" href="https://sharpmind.se/">Sharpmind</a>, I'm
            currently studying a Master's degree in Interactive Media Technology
            at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. One of the great things about
            being located in Stockholm is that you are very close to some of
            today's most excellent companies. I'm looking forward to attending
            further events and meeting with further inspiring people here.
